[RootConf](https://rootconf.in/2014/) , [MetaRefresh](https://metarefresh.in/2014/), [JSConf Asia](http://2014.jsconf.asia/), [MozCamp India](https://wiki.mozilla.org/MozCamps_2014) and many other conferences have discovered an easy way to make their events even more valuable to attendees.

Conferences are as much about networking and community building as they are about the content, so these events have Scrollback rooms where participants can network with each other, share anecdotes and have extended QA sessions with the speakers.

Do you organize conferences or meetups? This post is about how you can benefit from this a free and open source platform for communities.

#### Scrollback rooms are easy to [create and configure](http://scrollback.github.io/gettingStarted.html).

* The basic set up takes under two minutes. [Go to the Scrollback homepage](http://scrollback.io), type the name of your event, sign in and save the room.

* In the room’s configuration panel, click “Embed” to get an HTML snippet that you can paste into your website’s code. This adds the Scrollback room to your website, so that people can start talking to you and each other weeks before the event.

* Click “Twitter” in the config panel to link the room with the event’s Twitter hashtags and handles. This brings interesting tweets right into your Scrollback room.

* Is your community on IRC? We love IRC too! You can link your room with your IRC channel so that it becomes one seamless chatroom.

* Scrollback's [conversation](http://scrollback.github.io/conversation.html) feature automatically categorizes the chat into different threads and archives them. At one glance, the organizer can followup on all that has been happening during the event.

* The well-organized archives can be converted into a beautiful HTML retrospective, which can include photos and videos from your conference.<sup>1</sup>

* If your event is live streamed, Scrollback bridges the gap between viewers and those at the conference. Through Scrollback, live stream viewers can chat with other attendees or ask the speakers questions (your MC can select what to read out). Use the embed script to add Scrollback to your live streaming page.

* See an interesting comment or discussion in your Scrollback room during the event? Share it with the world (i.e. Twitter and Facebook) without leaving Scrollback!

* To keep things safe for your attendees, you have a robust set of moderation and access controls in your Scrollback room. Click “Permissions” to change the default settings.

*<sup>1</sup>This feature is still under development. If you need it, email us.*

*If you have ideas for any new features for Scrollback, We'd love to know.*
