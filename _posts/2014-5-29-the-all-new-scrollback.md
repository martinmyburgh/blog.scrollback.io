## For current room owners
Transitioning from the current Scrollback to the new
If you own a room on Scrollback, you will need to make note of a few things:

### 1. CSS Customizations:
If you have added any css customization to your widget, those will stop working with the new version. In that case, please get back to us before 18th of June 2014 so that we can make those css changes for you and your end users are not effected by the change. You can inform us at [evans@scrollback.io](mailto:evans@scrollback.io).

### 2. Unclaimed rooms:
If you have not "claimed" and configured your room already, we highly recommend you to do it before the 18th of June. Later, configuring those rooms will not be possible.

You can [read our documentation](/docs/claiming-room) for more information on how to claim a room on Scrollback.

### 3. Suggestions and Feedback
We request you to play around our trial version and get back to us with all your suggestions, feedbacks and issues.

Meanwhile, do try out the new Scrollback demo of your room on Scrollback as well as on your website at [next.scrollback.io](http://next.scrollback.io) and give us your feedback.
