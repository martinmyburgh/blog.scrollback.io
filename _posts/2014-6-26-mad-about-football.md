## Up for a game?

The rules are simple:

* Every hour, a new question will be posted on our [FIFA room](https://scrollback.io/fifa-worldcup-2014/). Every right answer will fetch you 10 points.

* Sometime during the day, there will be a prediction question related to that day’s match. If you guess correctly before the match starts, you’ll score 50 points.

  Even if your guess turns out to be wrong, but your answer was same as that of the majority, you get 30 points: chat with people and persuade them to pick the same option as you!
  
### How to play?

* Scores will be counted and a leaderboard will be maintained everyday on this same blog. Keep checking for your rank. 
On 13th of July, the top three players bag away some awesome prizes!

* If you manage to hold the top position on the leaderboard for 3 consecutive days, you manage to bag some cool Scrollback goodies.

* If you can convince someone else to start playing the game and he/she gets to the leaderboard, it will fetch you 100 straight points.
For this, the new player will need to tweet mentioning your nick as the referral person.

* At any one time of the day, there will be a non FIFA question in the room. That question will need clues to be cracked. During that one hour game play, clues will be left ramdomly in the room.
The scoring criteria for this will be as follows:
	* If you can answer the question without needing a single clue - 100 points
    * If you answer the question after the first clue - 50 points
    * If you answer the question after the second clue - 25 points
    * If you answer the question after the third clue -  10 points and after that, no marks at all!!! 	
    **Warning: For every wrong answer to this special question, you lose 20 points.**

*Please make sure to login before you begin the game play, else we will not be able to track your scores. Also, please use the Scrollback username while answering.*
